        I earned my Bachelor’s degree from the University of Texas at Arlington and moved right into finance. After starting my family, I started spending a lot time with children, being involved with my own child, as well as the children at her school. During my involvement I started using children’s game apps as a learning tool. I found myself manipulating the apps to help reinforce lessons and concepts. The apps were very successful with children with learning disabilities. I soon found myself wanting to reach more than just the children I had direct contact with, so I reached out to my local university, Southern Methodist University (SMU), for assistance with building my coding skills. I am currently a financial analyst who loves coding and who has a passion for changing lives for the better.
